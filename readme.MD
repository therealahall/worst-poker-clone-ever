# Welcome

Welcome to my first ever Godot project! I've been a lifelong video game fan and have always wanted to build games but never quite made my way into the industry. I figured this could be a cool way to mess around with a tech I don't normally get to use and learn a little bit about the art of making video games in 2024. I expect that there are going to be a lot of things I do wrong here in this repo and so I'm open to feedback and ideas.
